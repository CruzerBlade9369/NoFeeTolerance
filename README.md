# NoFeeTolerance

Do you want to put off your engine's maintenance, but the fee tolerance limit isn't letting you take any more jobs because of it? This mod effectively removes that limit, so you can accumulate as much debt as you want and still be able to take jobs, while your engine begs you with tears to service it.

This mod works by patching the FeeTolerance function to always return an infinite value, thus effectively removing the fee tolerance limit. Simple as that, no complicated methods at all (still took me a whole 2 days to get it working).
